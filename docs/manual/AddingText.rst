Adding Text |NoteIcon|
----------------------

To add text, click the note icon |NoteIcon| on the right end of the controls.  A text window will popup.  The intent was to 
provide two types of annotation: notes and titles.  The icon in the upper left toggles between |BigText| and |LittleText| to
switch between text sizes, as shown in Figures 47A and 47B.  The |BigText| icon increases the text size to generate a title.  
The |LittleText| icon decreases the text size back to a font more suitable for notes.  The text window can be closed and 
resized using the |Close| and |Resize| icons, respectively.  The icons are only visible when the mouse is in the window.  
Figure 48 provides an example showing both types of annotation.  Notes in combination with bookmarks can be used to draw 
the attention of project members to discoveries or generate explanatory visualizations that can be self-contained.
