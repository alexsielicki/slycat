Automatic Scaling
-----------------
The auto-scale button |AutoScaleIcon| (to the right of *Media Set*) enables/disables automatic scaling of the scatterplot 
axes when points are hidden or filtered out (these two mechanisms are mutually exclusive, see *Selection Action* and 
*Filtering*).  As points are removed, the locations of the remaining points shift to span the available space and the axes 
are redrawn to reflect the reduced value range.  The mapping between point colors and the values shown in the legend is also 
modified to reflect the reduced value range (i.e. the new maximum value is now mapped to the brightest red and the new 
minimum value maps to the deepest blue, maximizing the color distinctions between the remaining points).  Compare the 
scatterplots in Figure 40 and Figure 41 to see the effects of using auto-scaling.

This feature is especially useful if a variableâ€™s value range is skewed by a few anomalous points.  For example, imagine a 
data set where most points have x-coordinates in the range from 0 to 1, but a few points have extreme values of 10,000.  
Including the extreme points means that most of the plot consists of empty space, while the majority of points are drawn 
on top of one another near the origin.  By filtering and rescaling, you can remove the extreme points and have the remaining 
points fill the plot.  Note that automatic scaling is enabled as the default, indicated by the darkened state of the button 
(Figure 41).
