Bookmarks
---------

Each time you interact with a model, changes in model state are preserved in a Bookmark and the URL in your browser’s address bar is 
modified to incorporate the latest bookmark id.  The id links to a description of the model state that is stored on the Slycat™ server.  
Although the contents of a bookmark are model dependent, all bookmarks capture the current visualization state so that it can be 
reproduced (though parameters such as view region sizes are not saved, since they are device dependent).  Examples of the types of 
information stored in a bookmark include color-encoding, highlighted selections, filter values and limits, pinned media selections, and 
hidden points.  

Bookmarking enables many useful functions.  Dragging and dropping the URL from the address bar into an email, you can share a specific 
state of the visualization with other project members.  If you save model pages as browser bookmarks, you can archive and recall 
interesting model states, though you will be limited to viewing them on the machine where you created them.  The current bookmark id is 
stored locally in your browser’s cache.  This enables you to pick up where you left off when you begin a new session with a previously 
viewed model.  

Within Slycat™ there is the concept of a saved *Bookmark*.  This *Bookmark* is a persistent link to a model state that you explicitly 
save within a project.  Slycat™ saves the current bookmark id along with a label that you provide.  This provides a convenient, machine-
independent mechanism for saving exploratory results.  *Bookmarks* can be used to remember visualizations that reveal interesting 
patterns, to share findings with other team members, or to create a flipbook-style narrative for a demonstration.  

To create a *Bookmark*, click the blue *Bookmarks* button from within a model page and select *Create New* (Figure 10).  A 
*Create Saved Bookmark* popup will appear (Figure 11).  Type in a *Name* and click the *Save Bookmark* button on the right to save it, or 
click on the *X* button in the upper right corner of the dialog to abort the operation.  The *Bookmarks* button dropdown will display a 
list of all the bookmarks associated with the project.  If you are on a model page, *Bookmarks* associated with that model are listed at 
the top, while those for other models appear below, each labeled with their model type.  Clicking on a *Bookmark* in the list takes you
to the associated model and visualizes it according to the saved state.  To modify the name of a bookmark, click on the yellow pencil 
icon.  To delete a bookmark, click on its red trashcan.

Note that changes to the *View Regions* are not currently preserved in bookmarks.  Consequently, when the layout has been modified prior 
to the model being bookmarked, visualizing the *Bookmark* will render the model using the default *View Regions* layout.
