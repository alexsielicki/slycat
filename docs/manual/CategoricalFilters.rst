Categorical Filters
-------------------

Initially, all filter buttons are on (visible values are colored blue), as shown below.  So all values are visible the first 
time that a filter is instantiated.  Clicking a blue button sets its state to off, colors the button gray (hidden values are 
colored gray), hides points with that value in the scatterplot, and grays/fades the corresponding rows in the table.  Buttons 
are toggles, so clicking the button again restores that valueâ€™s point visibility in the plot and re-colors those rows in the 
table.

   **All filter values are initially visible the first time a filter is instantiated.**
   
In addition to individual buttons, group operations are also available through the three icons |FilterIcons| at the bottom of 
the filter.  Use |AllOnIcon| to turn all buttons on, |AllOffIcon| to turn all buttons off, and |InvertIcon| to flip the states 
of all buttons.  As an example of using group operations, imagine that you wanted to see only cars with 5-cylinder engines.  
You could turn all buttons off with |AllOffIcon| , then click button 5 to show just those points.  This would be faster than 
individually turning off the 3, 4, 6, and 8-cylinder buttons.

For categorical filters, sometimes the width of the button label exceeds the width of the button.  To expand the filter width, 
click the |ExpandIcon| icon in the upper right corner of the filter.  This will widen the filter and replace the |ExpandIcon| 
icon with the |CollapseIcon| icon.  To collapse the filter back to its original width, click the |CollapseIcon| icon.
