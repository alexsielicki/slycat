Creating a CCA Model
--------------------

Slycat™ accepts two file formats for table data, either Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, or Dakota tabular files (generated by 
Dakota [#]_, software which is frequently used to generate ensemble data sets).  If your data is not currently in one of these two 
formats, Excel can be used to create CSV files from most common table formats.  Note that if output metrics have been created 
separately in a post-processing step, they will need to be integrated with the inputs into a single file prior to model creation.  
In a CSV file, we expect to see only a single row of header information consisting of the column names.

From your project page, click on the green *Create* button and select *New CCA Model* from the dropdown list.  A dialog for walking 
you through the process will then pop up, as shown in Figure 14.  The first page of the model creation wizard identifies whether 
the table is located on the local machine or whether the data is held on a remote machine.  Select *Local* or *Remote*, followed by 
*Continue* to advance to the next page of the wizard.

Local Files
===========

As shown in Figure 15, if you selected *Local*, the next page will display two fields, *File* and *Filetype*.  Adjacent to 
*File*, is the button *Browse*.  Clicking *Browse* brings up a local file browser, which you can use to navigate to the location 
of your data table.  After selecting a file, the file browser closes and the name of your selected file appears to the right of 
the *Browse* button, as shown in Figure 16.  Depending on the format of the selected file, select either *CSV* or 
*Dakota tabular* from the *Filetype* dropdown, followed by *Continue* to read the file.  Note, you can change your mind and read 
the table from a *Remote* host by clicking the *Back* button to return to the previous page.

Remote Files
============

As shown in Figure 17, if you select *Remote*, the *Choose Host* page enables you to log into a remote machine through Slycat™.  
First select a machine from the dropdown list, which is revealed by clicking the triangle to the right of *Hostname*.  If the 
machine you wish to access is not on the list, type the machine name into the field.  The name will be remembered and used as 
the default host for the next time.  *Username* defaults to the username that you provided when logging into Slycat™, but this 
field can be manually edited if desired.  Finally, enter your *Password* and click the *Continue* button in the lower right to 
connect to the remote host.

Once you are connected, the model creation wizard will display a remote file browser.  If you have previously accessed this 
machine through Slycat™, the browser directory will be initialized to your last location.  Otherwise, the browser default 
directory will be the machine’s root directory.  There are two methods for navigating the remote directory structure to find 
your data: (1) if you know the full directory path, type it directly into the field at the top of the page (shown in Figure 18) 
and click the *Go* button;

or (2) move up and down the directory hierarchy by clicking on folders in the list.  Clicking on |UpFolder| (the folder labeled 
‘..’ in the file list), or on the *Up Directory* button |UpDirectory| (to the right of the file path) moves you up a level in 
the hierarchy, while clicking on a named folder moves you down a level.  Once you are in the directory that contains your table 
data, click on the file to select it.  Ensure that the format shown in the *Filetype* dropdown matches the selected file’s type, 
then click *Continue* to read the file.  Note, you can change your mind and read the table from your *Local* host by clicking 
the *Back* button to return to the previous page.
