Name Model
==========

The final page of the CCA model creation wizard, shown in Figure 22, provides editable fields to enter a *Name* and an optional 
*Description* for the model.  A default name of *New CCA Model* is provided, but the model list on the project page will become 
uninterpretable if you use this for all your models. Additionally, you should select a *Marking* from the dropdown list of 
choices.  These markings are specific to your institution and the Slycat™ server you are using.  The selected marking identifies 
the sensitivity of the data that is being analyzed, both for your own benefit and for other team members.  This marking is used 
to label the model, both on the project page and within banners at the top and bottom of the model visualization.  Once this 
information has been entered, click the *Finish & Go To Model* button in the lower right.  Slycat™ will then transfer you to the 
model visualization page.  When the analysis has completed, the CCA model will be displayed.  If processing is still ongoing, 
the message “The model is being computed. Patience!” will be shown.
