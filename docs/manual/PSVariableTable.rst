Variable Table
--------------

The *Variable Table* is the same as the table in the CCA model (see Variable Table) with one small difference.  **‘X’** 
and **‘Y’** icons to the right of variable names in the column headers provide an alternate method to the dropdown lists 
for selecting the scatterplot axes.
