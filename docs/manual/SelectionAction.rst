Selection Action
----------------

Selected points (see Selecting Points) create a set that is used as the designated input for any of the group operations 
listed in the *Selection Action* dropdown, as shown in Figure 42.  Since filtering and hide/show selections are mutually 
exclusive within the Slycatâ„¢ interface, if there are any filters enabled (visible), all of these actions, except *Pin*, 
will be disabled.

*Hide* removes the selected points from the scatterplot and yellows out the associated rows from the table.  The points are 
still selected, but they are no longer visible, which is why their rows are colored yellow instead of white.  If automatic 
scaling is enabled (see Automatic Scaling), the remaining visible points in the scatterplot will be shifted and recolored 
to reflect any changes in the value range.  

*Hide Unselected* performs the same operation on the set of points that are not selected, thereby reducing the visible points 
to just the selected set.  

*Show* restores the last hidden selection to visibility, both in the scatterplot and in the table.  If the selection has been 
lost by clicking elsewhere within the scatterplot, *Show* will not be able to restore the previously hidden set, since the 
selected set is now empty.  For the same reason, there is not a function to restore points hidden using *Hide Unselected*.  
However, the *Show All* button (to the right of the *Selection Action* dropdown) can be used to make all hidden points visible 
again.

Using the currently selected media variable, *Pin* retrieves and pins items for each of the points in the selection set (only 
if visible), performing the equivalent of a group hover and pin operation.  This is much more efficient than doing individual 
retrieval when there are large numbers of runs to compare.  Note that the images may be stacked on top of one another if the 
associated points are coincident, as is the case in Figure 43.  However, you can separate the images by dragging them apart, 
as shown in Figure 44.
