Templates
---------

*Templates* are essentially *Bookmarks*, but they lack an associated model.  *Templates* provide a means for applying the same 
visualization state to another model of that same model type.  Note that the similarity between the template’s original data and the new 
data set will determine the similarity of the resulting visualization.  For dissimilar data, some portions of the saved state may not be 
applicable (in which case those attributes are ignored), or the results may significantly differ from your expectations.

To create a *Template*, click the green *Create* button, then select *Template* from the dropdown list.  A *Create Template* popup will 
appear.  Type in a *Name* and click the *Save Template* button on the right to save it, or click the *X* button to abort the operation.

To apply a *Template* to a model, from within that model’s page click the yellow *Edit* button and select *Apply Template* from the 
dropdown list (Figure 12).  The *Apply Template* popup will appear.  Select the name of the template that you wish to use from the list 
and click the *Apply Template* button on the right to execute, or click the *X* button to abort the operation. Note that bookmarks can 
also be used as templates, so they are included in the list of available templates (Figure 13).  However, they are not interchangeable.  
*Templates* will not appear in the *Bookmarks* dropdown list, since they cannot be rendered without an associated model.
